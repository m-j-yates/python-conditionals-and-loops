## 📚 Exercise Overview

**Platform:** Google Colab  
**Language:** Python  
**Focus Areas:**  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Looping constructs (`while`, `for`)  
- Input handling and validation  
- Mathematical operations and number theory  
- Interactive menu design and user feedback

## 🧪 Exercises & Logic Summary

### 🔐 Security Door Access
- Validates a numeric access code using a `while` loop  
- Tracks failed attempts and grants access on correct input  
- Demonstrates basic authentication logic

### ➗ Divisibility Checker
- Uses the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 7  
- Provides clear feedback based on result

### 🧮 Menu-Driven Calculator
- Presents a looped menu with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Handles user input and performs selected operation  
- Includes division-by-zero protection

### 🚶‍♂️ Fitness Tracker – Step Summation
- Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-defined value  
- Uses a `for` loop and accumulator pattern  
- Demonstrates arithmetic progression logic

### 🔢 Prime Number Checker
- Checks if a number is prime using a `for` loop and modulus logic  
- Handles edge cases (e.g., numbers ≤ 1)  
- Displays factor breakdown if not prime

### 🧩 Factorial Calculator
- Uses `math.factorial()` to compute factorial of a non-negative integer  
- Demonstrates use of external libraries and mathematical functions

### 🔢 Number Staircase Pattern
- Uses nested `for` loops to print a staircase pattern of numbers  
- Reinforces loop nesting and output formatting
